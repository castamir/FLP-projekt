Simple Grep
===========

NAME
----
	xsurov03 - print lines matching simplified pattern


SYNOPSIS
--------
	./xsurov03 [options] PATTERN [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
	xsurov03 is a simple grep searches the named input FILE (or standard input
	if no file is given) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.
	By default, Simple grep prints the matching lines.

OPTIONS
-------
	-p
		Ignore given input. Prints a minimal finite automata (MFA) coresponding
		to the PATERN as a table of rules with MFA definition.

	-v
		Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.


REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
-------------------
	A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings. Regular 
	expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using
	various operators to combine smaller expressions.
	
	xsurov03 is similar to "extended" version of regular expression syntax.
	Main difference between xsurov03 and GNU grep -e is in not supported '{' and
	'}' parenthesis thats specify a number of repetitions.
	
	The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a 
	single character. Most characters, including all letters and digits, are 
	regular expressions that match themselves.
	
	A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by [ and ]. It matches
	any single character in that list; if the first	 character of the list is
	the caret ^ then it matches any character not in the list. For example, the
	regular expression [0123456789] matches any single digit.
	
	Within a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two characters
	separated by a hyphen. It matches any single character that sorts between
	the two characters, inclusive, using the ASCII collating sequence and
	character set. For example [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd].

	The period . matches any single character.
	
	A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:
	?	The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
	*	The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
	+	The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
	
	Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
	expression matches any string formed by	concatenating two substrings that
	respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.
	
	Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator |; the resulting
	regular expression matches any string matching either subexpression.
	
	Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
	precedence over alternation. A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
	parentheses to override these precedence rules.
	
	xsurov03 is restricted to filter input made from a limited set od symbols.
	Each symbol of the given input MUST match the following PATTERN:
	[a-zA-Z0-9 ].
